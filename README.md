Mobile development first assignment

## Student ID: 11254228

This project consists of four tasks related to array manipulation and user profile creation.

### Task 1: Array Manipulation

- Create a JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js`.
- Implement a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: Formatting Array Strings

- Add a function `formatArrayStrings` to the `arrayManipulation.js` file.
- This function takes two arrays as arguments:
  - An array of strings.
  - An array of numbers processed by the `processArray` function.
- The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number:
  - Capitalize the entire string if the number is even.
  - Convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3: Creating User Profiles

- Create a file `userInfo.js`.
- Implement a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
- The function returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).

### Task 4: README File

- This README file provides a brief explanation of each task and includes my student ID.
